### Definition
* Agents acting on environments
* Gold Standard - humans?
    * Think Humanly - Cognitive Modeling
    * Act Humanly - Turing Test
* Gold Standard - rationality
    * Performance based - rank chess engine on wins over other engines.
    * Define task specific environment
    * Think rationally
    * Act rationally

# Turing Tests
* Can you distinguish between computer and human controller?
* Turing's claim - if the performance is indistinguishable, then the two systems are equivalent.
* Critiques?
    * Maybe people aren't good at distinguishing?
    * What is a representative human?
    * Why is text communication the only proposed channel? Total Turing Test - add pictures and robotic manipulation
    * Searle's Chinese room - human uses rulebooks to manipulate chinese symbols, appears to be a native chinese speaker. Argument from consciousness

* If we are concerned with performance, the question of "How do humans do it?" isn't really relevant.
* Step by step approach to goal. If you can show each step is valid, then conclusion is valid. However, that's expensive computationally, provable performance is hard and limited.
* So don't worry about how the thinking works, look at how you act.
