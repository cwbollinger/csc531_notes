# CS531 - AI
### Birth of AI
* John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon
* Dartmouth workshop, 1956
* Arthur Samuel - learning checkers AI
* Newell and Simon - General Problem Solver, Principa Mathematica theorems

### Interdisciplinary Field
* Philosophy
* Engineering
* Psychology
* Economics/Game Theory
* Linguistics
* Control Theory
* Mathematics
* Biology

### Difficulties of Early AI
1. Combinatorial Explosion - state spaces get big fast. Chess states >> # atoms in universe. Cannot exhaustively search.
2. Difficulty of capturing "common sense" in a computer. Winograd Schemas - sentence ambiguity.
3. Representational inadequacy. Rosenblatt's Perceptron Theorem looks promising, but only works for representing linear separable functions.

### AI becomes an industry
* Knowledge-based systems (rules-based)
    * Dendral - inferred molecular structure from mass spectrograms.
    * MYCIN - medical diagnosis. Pioneered certainty factors

### Machine Learning
* Expert systems create "knowledge acquisition" bottleneck
* Designing/maintaining rules is expensive/labor-intensive
* Sometimes experts aren't conscious of the rules
* ML has advanced rapidly in last 30 years.
    * Supervised learning: train on input->output examples
    * Reinforcement Learning: Learn a mapping from states->actions that maximizes task performance
    * Deep learning: Uses (deep) NN for knowledge representation. Applies to supervised and reinforcement learning.

### Recent AI Contributions
* Self-driving cars
* Speech recognition
* Machine translation
* Game playing
* Robotic applications
* Logistics planning
* Astronomy

### Downsides
* Dangers from malfunction or mis-specification
    * Telsa - false sense of security
* Dangers of learning
    * Bad data -> bad results
    * Reinforces existing data correlations
    * Can be taught bad behaviors
* TAKE ALL TEH JOBS.
* Abuse by powers (surveillance, tracking, killbots)
* Singularity, TRANSCENDENCE, something something Moore's law
* TEH APOCALYPSE IS NIGH
