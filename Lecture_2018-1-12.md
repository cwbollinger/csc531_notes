### Agents and Environments
* What is an agent?
    * Changes environment with actuators
    * Observes environment with sensors
    * Not clear what is/isn't an Agents
#### Example: Vacuum Cleaner Agent
* Percept: What agent sees currently
* Percept history: what an agent perceived from t=0 -> now (reverse order)
* Agent function: mapping from **percept history** -> **actions**

### Rationality
* Agent program - implements agent function
* Performance measure - metric for how well agent is doing. E.g., average number of clean cells in any time step
* Rational Agent: for each possible **percept sequence**, agent selects action that is *expected* to maximize performance measure
* A rational agent is not omniscient, but this is fine (e.g. weather in Tokyo isn't relevant to cleaning house)
* A rational agent is not clairvoyant, so future is unknown

### PEAS Description
* Performance
* Environments
* Actuators
* Sensors

### Agent Types
##### Simple Reflex Agent
* No memory
* If-then rules
##### Model-based Reflex Agent
* Includes model of how the world works
##### Model-based Goal-based Agent
* Observes world, and predicts impact of actions on world
* Chooses actions to achieve goal
##### Model-based Utility-based Agent
* Observes world, and predicts impact of actions on world
* Estimate how good the resulting states will be
* Choose action that offers greatest utility

##### Properties of Environments
