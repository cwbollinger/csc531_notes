### Search Problems
* Given initial state, goal, possible actions, find a sequence that satisfies the goal. E.g. path planning, planning course sequence for graduation, timetable scheduling, robotic assembly.

##### Components of Search Problems
* States
* Initial State
* Applicable Actions: Actions(s)
* Transition Model: Result(s, a)
* Successor: set of states that can be reached from a given state
* State Space Graph: directed graph of states and transitions
* Path: sequence of states connected by actions

###### Two Room Vacuum Cleaner
* Domain: 2 rooms that may be dirty. Robot can move left or right, and clean the dirt in the room it is in.
    * Fully observable
    * Deterministic
    * Sequential
    * Discrete
    * Static
* Properties
    * 8 Discrete States

##### Search Components
* Goal test
* Solution
* Step cost
* Path cost: sum of step costs
* Optimal solution: least cost path

##### Path Planning
* States
* Initial and Goal states
* Applicable Actions
* Transition Model
* Path Cost
* A Solution

#### Traveling Salesman Problem
* What are the...
    * States? Set of visited cities and current city
    * Initial State: Starting city
    * Applicable Actions: Cities you can visit from current city
    * Transition Model: links between cities
    * Goal condition: Being in the initial city with all cities in the visited cities
    * Path cost: sum of costs over all links traveled
