##### Tree Search
* Start with initial state as root node
* Repeat Nmax steps
    * **Select** and remove node p from search frontier
    * Return if it is goal
    * **Expand** p - generate all sucessors
    * Add them to the frontier as p's children

##### Motivating Graph Search
* Loopy paths - going from A to B to A - infinite trees
* Duplicate paths - multiple paths to the same state.

##### Graph Search
* Start with initial state as root node
* Repeat Nmax steps
    * **Select** and remove node from frontier. *mark as expanded*
    * **Expand**
    * Add successors to frontier as children, *unless previously expanded/in frontier*

##### Breadth First Search
* Search frontier is FIFO
