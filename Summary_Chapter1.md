### What is AI?
Four approaches
* Acting Humanly
    * Turing Test - behavior indistinguishable from human mind
    * Flaw: Why is acting human the goal? E.g. airplanes vs. birds.
* Thinking Humanly
    * Cognitive modeling
    * Overlap with cognitive science, e.g. computer vision
    * Flaw: good algorithms are not necessarily human-like.
* Thinking Rationally
    * "Laws of Thought"
    * Aristotle, logical rules
    * Formal proofs
    * Flaw: Hard to model reality formally, theory vs. practice
* Acting Rationally
    * Rational agent - act to achieve the "best (expected) outcome"
    * Mathematically defined and general.
    * Approach taken by most modern AI

### Foundations of AI
* Philosophy
* Mathematics
* Economics
* Neuroscience
* Psychology
* Computer Engineering
* Control theory and cybernetics
* Linguistics

### History of AI
##### Gestational AI (1943-1955)
* (1943) Warren McCulloch & Walter Pitts - neural structures can approximate any computable function
* (1949) Donald Hebb - Hebbian learning rule
* (1950) Marvin Minsky & Dean Emonds - SNARC, neural computer
* (1950) Alan Turing *Computing Machinery and Intelligence* - Turing Test, machine learning, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning
##### The birth of AI (1956)
* (1956) Dartmouth workshop
* AI as an interdisciplinary field, not located under any one existing field
##### Early enthusiasm (1952-1969)
* (1956) Newell and Simon General Problem Solver (GPS). "Thinking Humanly" approach. *Physical System Symbol* hypothesis: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action."
* IBM, Nathaniel Rochester
* (1959) Herbert Gelernter, Geometry Theorem Prover
* (1952) Arthur Samuel, checkers AI. Demonstrated on TV 1956.
* (1958) John McCarthy, List, time-sharing, *Programs with Common Sense*
* (1965) J.A. Robinson, resolution method
* (1969) Cordell Green, question-answering and planning systems
* Shakey the robot
* Microworld problems: James Slagle SAINT (1963), Tom Evans ANALOGY (1968), Daniel Bobrow STUDENT (1967) David Hufman (1971), David Waltz (1975), Patrick Winston (1970), Terry Winograd (1972), Scott Fahlman (1974) BLOCKS
##### Dose of reality (1966-1973)
* (1957) Herbert Simon, bold predictions on performance
* Reality - combinatorial explosion, (Lighthill report 1973) critiques existing approaches
##### Knowledge-based Systems (1969-1979)
* Previous emphasis on **weak methods**, general but not good at solving complex problems
* Use powerful, domain-specific programs
* (1969) DENDRAL, spectrometer analysis
* Heuristic Programming Project, MYCIN (certainty factors), Winograd's SHRDLU (natural language)
* Consensus towards needing general knowledge
* Need for better knowledge representation schemes: Prolog, PLANNER.
* Minsky's frames (1975), taxonomic hierarchical representation of facts.
##### AI becomes an industry (1980-present)
* Commercial expert systems: R1 (1982), "Fifth Generation" project (1981)
##### Return of neural networks (1986-present)
* (mid 1980's) Back-propagation reinvented (originally discovered 1969)
* (1986) Rumelhart and McClelland, *Parallel Distributed Processing*
##### AI adopts the scientific method (1987-present)
* Move towards building on existing theories, use of proofs.
* Use of *Hidden Markov Models*, rigorous mathematically and generated from training on datasets.
* (1988) Judea Pearl, *Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems* brings probability theory to AI. Bayesian networks.
* Horvitz and Heckerman, *normative* expert systems that act according to decision theory
* Application of machine learning as general problem-solving tool.
##### Emergence of Intelligent Agents (1995-present)
* Internet chatbots, search engines, etc.
* AI drawn closer to other fields.
* Discontent from founders, more focus on specific solution rather than general problem solving.
##### Availability of very large data sets (2001-present)
* Focus on data over algorithms
* (1995) Yarowsky - word-sense disambiguation
* (2001) Banko and Brill - more data -> better performance
* Solve knowledge bottleneck with learning methods.``
